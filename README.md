# Climate-Change-Track-Conquerors-

**INTRO AND PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
    The waste disposal management systems in the Cities around the world, specifically India are facing challenges due to ever-increasing urbanization,  concomitantly, rising volume of waste generated and littering. In order to ensure timely collection of food and other perishable wastes prone to degeneration, Municipal authorities have introduced a static sensor in areas like market.
    
    Since the wastes are generated at wider locations in the cities, but there is a possibility of air pollution, unless the waste collection is timely tracked. The Proposed system is a wireless system and can be moved which can detect and map the location, and can transmit the detailed information about the intensity of odor, location and time, to the authority for action.  

Public waste bins are filling up faster than ever and inevitably many of the bins end up overflowing before collected, causing not only cluttered streets and bad odours but also negative health and environmental impacts.

The toxic substances in air contaminated by waste include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. In everyday life, we identify the polluted air especially through bad odours, which are usually caused by decomposing and liquid waste items.

Overflowing garbage smell causes various respiratory  	diseases ,air quality also decreases and other adverse health 	effects as contaminants are absorbed from lungs into other 	parts of the body.

**PROPOSED SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION**
Odor sensing device continuously detects, measures and monitors the odourful gaseous contaminants. 

The solution incorporates Odor Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling for predicting odor impact on the surrounding area depending on meteorological conditions.

 With the help of meteorological data, the Odor sensing device can trace the odorant dispersion plume incited by conditions like wind speed and wind direction.
 
 The odor sensing devices with LORA gives a best  cost effective performance .
 
This makes it an ideal choice for landfill sites, wastewater treatment facilities, fertilizers, paper-pulp industries and soil-treatment sites, etc.

**INNOVATION**
The sensors introduced by the Muncipal Authorities are static and accordingly, placed only in  a few select locations. 

In the proposed system sensor is fitted in any vehicles plying in the city, and supports city wide tracking of odour across multiple locations.  This would ensure that considerable data points are gathered and the municipal authorities can initiate actions depending upon intensity of the odour or as per their plan.

Given the increased attention to cleanliness amongst the cities (like Swach Bharat Abhiyan and Ranking of Cities based on cleanliness), the project can support relevant authorities for ensuring better living conditions by reducing the hazardous odour and timely waste collection.

**ADVANTAGES**

Quality of the air can be measured. 
Further this can be continued as the connected vehicles by the automotive industries.
Prevents spreading of disease by detecting the foul smell of dead animals.
